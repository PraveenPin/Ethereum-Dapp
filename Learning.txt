truffle console :
after deploying our smart contract to the blockchain using truffle migrate,
we can use truffle's console to interact directly with the contract using javascript

all the calls to the blockchain are asynchornous, it returns promises so we use await/async.

msg.sender - > gives the address of the caller

for tests we can add metadata, even though they are not required as function args that we are testing

Gas Fee:
Anytime we write an info to the blockchain, we have to pay a gas fee like a transactions fee
we have to also pay gas fee to call a functions of smart contracts that write/modify data on blockchain, but reads are fee

no floating point numbers on blockchain -> so we use unit WEI
